Movement is one of the most important things in TNT-Wizards. You always need to get in range and in many situations good positioning is the key to victory. 
As such all Wizard-Players should have a good sense of movement. There are at base (without abilities) four forces that influence your position: 
1) Gravity is often overlooked but a powerful tool, as falling is faster then the other base movement options. Letting yourself fall is a great way to dodge. 
2) Walking or running if you sprint. It is faster then in normal Minecraft as you have a constant speed buff and you should always run as hunger is nonexistent. Even in the air you can use it to move whilst for example you fall. 
3) Simple jump, which is higher than normal as you have a jump-boost. 
4) Double jump, which can be activated by hitting the spacebar (or whatever key you are using for jumping) twice in rapid succession. This will apply an upwards force as well as a force in the direction you are looking. As there is no cooldown you can effectively use it to «fly». Just remember to look in the direction you want to travel and spam spacebar.
