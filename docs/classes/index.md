# Classes

A **class** or **kit** determines which set of weapons and abilities a player gets when playing TNT-Wizards. Each class offers an *attack wand* and a *defense wand* and some even have passive abilities. There are currently 9 classes and all are permanently available to play.

They are roughly divided into *particle classes* and *projectile classes*. The core difference is that attacks of particle classes are identified by [particles], while the attacks of projectile classes use actual [projectiles]/[entities] native to Minecraft. Thus the attacks of projectile classes can be [deflected] and particle classes cannot. Particle classes are [Ice], [Kinetic], [Blood], [Toxic], [Storm] and [Ancient]. Projectile classes are the remaining [Fire], [Wither] and [Hydro]. Particle classes tend to have larger hitboxes than projectile classes, which simplifies fighting airborne targets (an exception are [Ancient] and [Hydro]).
